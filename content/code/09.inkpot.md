# Inkpot

Inkpot is something I've been wanting to work on forever. A writing platform. Not much progress has been made on it yet, besides a simple spec having been written up for the markup language, but watch this space!

The spec mentioned above is subject to change but it is intended to be a markup syntax for planning and writing novels. One idea is to include two types of header:

1. Visible headers; these will be included in the output, an example of which might be chapter headings
2. Non-visible headers; these will not be included in the output but the body of text beneath them will be, they are intended for organising a text

Below is an example of what this might look like, with `=` denoting visible headers and `-` denoting non-visible ones.

```
= My Manuscript

== Chapter One

--- Scene 1

Once upon a time...

--- Scene 2

And now that our stage is set...

== Chapter Two

--- Scene 3

The story continues...

== Chapter Three

...
```

A program interpreting the above syntax might include a feature like folds for each scene. A GUI application might allow for us to grab and reorganise the scenes if we decide that parts of our story feel out of order. Our manuscript might be represented as a tree appearing like:

```
h1. My Manuscript
  h2. Chapter One
    h3. Scene 1
    h3. Scene 2
  h2. Chapter 2
    h3. Scene 3
  h2. Chapter 3
```
