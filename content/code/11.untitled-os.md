# UntitledOS

I have begun work conceptualising my own "operating system" (really, it will be a distribution based on either #ArchLinux or #Debian). The aim is to create a small, somewhat-opinionated ISO that provides some basic tools and to build this using either #Archiso or #Cubic. Probably the former, as Arch is already my daily driver.
