# ThomBruce.com

ThomBruce.com is the site you're looking at. It has existed for a long time, but I've iterated on it a lot! Over the years, it has evolved from a simple #WordPress blogging site into an even simpler #Jekyll blogging site, then a #Hugo blogging site using my own @HugoModo template, and finally now the site is a really simple portfolio website built using #Nuxt.
