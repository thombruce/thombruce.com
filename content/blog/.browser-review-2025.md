# Browser Review 2025

<!--
    If we're chaging the title to the above...
    I need to also mention Brave and...
    What was the bare Chromium browser I used?
    And also Tor Browser (which I think is Gecko).
    Oh and Chrome Canary; I briefly used that too.
    I think I evaluated Vivaldi too before deciding
    I didn't like it. And I have in fact used
    Chrome this year, but only really for quick
    review of design work. Oh and Edge... I totally
    did use Edge.
    Anything else? I should log into my Windows
    partition and check...
-->

1. Firefox (hardened)
2. Helium (probably my preferred Chromium option)

_...which covers the Firefox engine and Chromium
(I don't see a need to install Chrome, Brave, Edge,
etc.). But what about Webkit?_

A Webkit browser does exist for Linux. It's called
GNOME Web (previously known as Epiphany).

Another option is Luakit? Luakit is a lot more
keyboard focused, like I've made Firefox using the
Tridactyl extension. But for browser testing...
I don't think I want this. I think I want the more
traditional GNOME Web experience.

Is this the best option? I do not know. It's hard
to evaluate--the GNOME website is constantly down!

So...

## Rendering Engines

### Blink (Chromium)

- Helium

### Webkit

- GNOME Web

### Gecko

- Firefox

### Goanna

_Goanna is a fork of Gecko and... I don't know that I need to support it.
It seems to be used only by Pale Moon and Basilisk._

_We're going to ignore Goanna for now, but should we wish to target it in
future, I think I'm more drawn to Pale Moon than to Basilisk._

## So Here's What I Now Have Installed...

1. Firefox (my goto, my daily web browser; made even better by Tridactyl)
2. Helium (which I will probably use A LOT during development; it's my Chromium browser)
3. GNOME Web (Epiphany via the Pacman repo; this is my Webkit choice)
