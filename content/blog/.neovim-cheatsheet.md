# Neovim Cheatsheet

_This article should begin by introducing some basic motions, then some basic operations.
After this, it should talk about combining motions with operations, e.g. `y5j`, a
combination which suggests I should also introduce numerical navigations like just `5j`._

_We'll start with movements, then more complex movements. Then we'll talk basic operations.
Finally, we will combine the two: Operations + Movements._

`gg`

`G`

`w`: Next word

`e`: Next end of word

`b`: Beginning of word

`$`: End of line

`^`: Beginning of line

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd>: Move down by half a page

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>u</kbd>: Move up by half a page

`zz`: Center view on current line

`z=`: Spelling suggestions (handy for prose!)

---

`yy`: Yank the current line

`yw`: Yank from cursor position to beginning of next word (includes the whitespace preceding next word)

`ye`: Yank from cursor to end of current word

`dd`: Delete the current line

`diw`: Delete from inside, the whole word under cursor

`diW`: Delete from inside, the whole non-whitespace range under cursor

`daw`: Delete around the current word, including trailing whitespace

_Note that those `*iw` modifiers also work for yank, and there are plenty more patterns, like paragraphs for instance._

`d13j`: Delete this and the next 13 lines (note: it is recommended to have `vim.wo.relativenumber = true
` set in your config for relative number lines)

`ggyG`: Goto to top of document (`gg`) and yank everything to the end of the document (`yG`)

`gcc`: Toggle line comment

---

<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>: Show definition (of word under cursor)

---

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd>: Goto definition

Similar:

<kbd>g</kbd><kbd>d</kbd>: Goto local definition (within scope)

<kbd>g</kbd><kbd>D</kbd>: Goto global definition (within file)

---

<kbd>q</kbd><kbd>a</kbd>: Start a macro recording (`a` is the macro register name, this could be any other character; Neovim will save this macro until it is overwritten)

<kbd>@</kbd><kbd>a</kbd>: Replay a macro for a given register
