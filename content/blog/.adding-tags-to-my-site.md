# Adding Tags to My Site

Types of tags we want to add:

- `#` hashtags
- `@` context tags
- `+` project tags

How we want them to be parsed from content:

1. Markdown YAML metadata
2. Parsed from the body of a markdown document

Example metadata:

```yaml
tags:
  - one
  - two
  - three
contexts:
  - ThomBruceDotCom
  - Marmalade
  - Inkpot
projects:
  - ThomBruceDotCom_addTagSupport
  - Marmalade_initProject
```

Example body:

```md
This is a paragraph with a #hashtag, a @context and a +project.
```

> [!NOTE]
> See how the example projects above read like `Context_someProject`?
> This is a pattern I want to follow, if not an exact syntax...
> Consider also: `+someProject@Context`. This looks better to me and
> feels more consistent with the context tags... which could even be
> omitted by way of the fact that the project tag includes them?
> Projects then sort of read like email addresses... which could be
> a source of conflict if we aren't careful.
