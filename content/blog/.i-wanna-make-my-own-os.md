# I Wanna Make My Own OS

Here's what I need to do...

+initialize@UntitledOS
+addPackagesTo@UntitledOS

I was somewhat inspired by the [r/writerDeck](https://www.reddit.com/r/writerDeck/) community on Reddit and I think...

My first iteration of this OS should be lean and exclusively focused on being a sort of writer deck OS.

...

Which existing OS as a basis?

1. Arch Linux? (using ArchISO)
2. Debian? (using Cubic)
3. NixOS? (using nix-build... maybe?)
4. Gentoo? (using Catalyst... maybe?)

...and part of the issue with choosing might be that I want to do something different for the writer deck OS than
I want to do for an eventual more programming-focused distro. Maybe?
