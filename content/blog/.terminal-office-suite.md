# Terminal Office Suite

## Word Processor

- Microsoft Office: Word
- LibreOffice: Writer

- Terminal: Neovim

## Spreadsheets

- Terminal: sc-im (maybe also VisiData)

## Presentations

This is trickier for a terminal app where we can't adjust the font size and add
pretty presentation elements...

But we can display images (Kitty, WezTerm, ...)

We can generate BIG ascii text...

We can certainly add charts...

We need a way to manage slides though. None should scroll; we should be able to
navigate back and forth between them.

## Database

- Terminal: SQLite (just that? Rainfrog? Something else?)

## Notes

- Microsoft Office: OneNote

- Terminal: Neovim again, but maybe with... Telekasten, Neorg... or should we say Emacs with Org-Mode?

## Other

- Teams? This is like... video-conferencing... That doesn't make sense in terminal but there are chat apps for communication.
- Email? I guess like... neomutt?
- Drive? Syncing? (Git, maybe? Maybe other solutions...)
- What about image creation/editing?
- What about a Publisher equivalent? Typst? Not exactly easy... Also not exactly terminal-only. Maybe just Markdown?
- Video Editing? Office has Clipchamp, but again this makes little sense in the terminal...

- Images? LibreOffice has Draw which looks to be... a vector graphics editor?
- It also has a formula editor (Math), but we can maybe recommend LaTeX for this??
- And a Charts module listed on the site, but we have a few options for creating in-terminal charts, right?
